naivebayes
==========

A multilabel Naive Bayes classifier for HTML documents.

Crawls a list of 100K links (training set) obtained from delicious.com and trains a classifier to suggest the 3
most relevant tags for an unobserved piece of text.

This was a weekend hack so the code is just a bunch of files doing adhoc stuff.

The file containing the links can be found at <>
